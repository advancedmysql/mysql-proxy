1. Go to the cetus_mgr directory
2. mkdir build/
3. cd build/
4. CFLAGS='-O2 -w' cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-ljemalloc" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/user/cetus_mgr_install

### 3. How to install
make install

### 4. How to run
1. Go to /home/user/cetus_mgr_install/conf
2. cp proxy.conf.example proxy.conf
3. Modify proxy.conf 
4. cp users.json.example users.json
5. Modify users.json

### 5. How to modify proxy.conf
1. Modify proxy-backend-addresses to be the primary address of MySQL Group Replication
2. Modify proxy-read-only-backend-addresses to be the secondary addresses of MySQL Group Replication
3. Modify default-username to be the valid user name that could have the privileges of both manipulating MySQL Group Replication and MySQL.
4. Modify log-file to be the valid file path.
5. Modify worker-processes to be appropriate number that best suits the workload.
6. Modify default-pool-size appropriately.
   
### 6. How to modify user.conf

## Note
1. Cetus runs only on Linux.
2. Cetus could not be compiled under MySQL 8.0 development.
3. Cetus only works for MySQL Group Replication.
4. Cetus only supports mysql_native_password.
5. As for MySQL Group Replication, please use the modified version which could be downloaded at https://github.com/session-replay-tools/MySQL.
6. RESET MASTER before runing MySQL Group Replication
7. Configure MySQL Group Replication before running cetus.
8. The total num of connections to each MySQL is equal to default-pool-size plus worker-processes.

## Bugs and feature requests:
If you encounter any issues with the release, I would encourage you to file a bug report.
Your feedback is really critical to myself and the rest of the team as we want to make cetus better.
